# "Getting and Cleaning data" Course Project CodeBook

1. This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
2. This repo includes a run_analysis.R file that does the following things:
    * Load the dataset to a dataframe.
    * Read both train and test dataset and combine them to one.
    * Added two more columns - ActivityLabels and Subject to the dataframe.
    * Also filtered the dataframe and extracted column names with mean() and std().
    * Modified the column names to descriptive.
    * Created a second independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
